Apollo Graph Manager's **schema registry** is a central hub for managing your data graph (as recommended by [Principled GraphQL](https://principledgraphql.com/integrity#3-track-the-schema-in-a-registry)). The schema registry enables you to explore your schema's types and fields, track its change history, and improve your production server's security by removing the need for introspection. You can also [register **variants** of your schema](#managing-environments-with-variants) that correspond to different environments, such as staging and production.

## Automatic registration

### Apollo Server

> **Automatic schema reporting is not available for graphs that use Apollo Federation.** If you have a federated graph, instead see [Setting up managed federation](./managed-federation/setup/).

Apollo Server version 2.15.1 and later can register its schema with Graph Manager automatically every time it starts up.

To do so, first obtain an API key for your data graph:

<ObtainGraphApiKey />

Then, set this API key as the value of the `APOLLO_KEY` environment variable in your server's environment. If you're using the [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) library, you can add the API key to the `.env` file in your project's root directory, like so:

```none:title=.env
APOLLO_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

Now every time your server starts up, it registers its schema with Graph Manager.

#### Registering automatically to a variant

Your server can register its schema to a particular [variant of your graph](#managing-environments-with-variants). Each of your server's environments (development, staging, production, etc.) should register to a different variant.

To do so, set the `APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT` environment variable in each server environment:

```none:title=.env
APOLLO_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT=staging
```

If you don't specify a variant, Apollo Server reports its schema to the default variant (named `current`).

### Other GraphQL servers

Any GraphQL server can perform automatic schema registration by implementing the [Schema reporting protocol](./schema-reporting-protocol/).

> Currently, we are not aware of GraphQL server libraries besides Apollo Server that implement the schema reporting protocol. If you add support to an open-source library, please let us know at **support@apollographql.com**!

## Manual registration

If you're using an earlier version of Apollo Server or another GraphQL server that doesn't support automatic schema reporting, you can register your schema via the [Apollo CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/).

First, complete the following setup for your project:

<ProjectConfigPanel />

Now you can run the `apollo service:push` command from your application's root directory, like so:

```
$ apollo service:push
  ✔ Loading Apollo Project
  ✔ Uploading service to Engine

id      schema        tag
──────  ────────────  ───────
190330  example-4218  current
```

The CLI fetches your schema via a configuration option you set up in the project configuration above and pushes it to Graph Manager.

### Registering manually to a variant

To register a schema to a particular [variant of your graph](#managing-environments-with-variants), include the `--variant=<VARIANT>` flag in your `apollo service:push` command, like so:

```bash
apollo service:push --variant=beta
```

If you omit the `--variant` flag, the `apollo service:push` command pushes to the default graph variant, named `current`.

## Registering with continuous delivery

To get the most out of Graph Manager, you should **register each update to your production schema as soon as it occurs**. Consequently, schema registration should be part of your continuous delivery pipeline.

If you're using [automatic schema reporting](#automatic-registration), registration happens automatically each time you deploy your production server. No additional continuous delivery configuration is required.

If you're [registering via the Apollo CLI](#manual-registration), include a call to `apollo service:push` in your continuous delivery pipeline.

Here's a sample continuous delivery configuration for pushing a schema to Apollo using CircleCI:

```yaml{13,29-31}
version: 2

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:8

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run: npm install
      # CircleCI needs global installs to be sudo
      - run: sudo npm install --global apollo

      # Start the GraphQL server.  If a different command is used to
      # start the server, use it in place of `npm start` here.
      - run:
          name: Starting server
          command: npm start
          background: true

      # make sure the server has enough time to start up before running
      # commands against it
      - run: sleep 5

      # When running on the 'master' branch, push the latest version
      # of the schema to Apollo Graph Manager.
      - run: |
          if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" == "master" ]; then
            apollo service:push --variant=master
          fi
```

## Tracking schema changes

The History view in Graph Manager lets you view the timeline of changes made to your schema:

![Schema history page in the Graph Manager UI](./img//schema-history.png)

**Only schema changes that you push to Graph Manager are included in this timeline**, which is one of the most important reasons to [include schema registration in your continuous delivery pipeline](#registering-with-continuous-delivery).

## Managing environments with variants

Commonly, your application's development and staging environments use schemas that differ slightly from your production schema (especially if you're actively working on updates to your schema).

Because these schemas represent different environments for the same application, it makes sense to associate them with each other. To achieve this, you define **variants** of your graph.

Each variant of a graph functions as a standalone graph. Each has its own change history, metrics, and operation registry.

### Registering a schema to a variant

* [Using automatic registration](#registering-automatically-to-a-variant)
* [Using the Apollo CLI](#registering-manually-to-a-variant)

### Associating metrics with a variant

You can configure Apollo Server to associate the metrics it sends to Graph Manager with a particular variant. To do so, set the `APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT` environment variable (`ENGINE_SCHEMA_TAG` in `apollo-server` pre-2.13.0) to the appropriate variant before initializing Apollo Server.

Alternatively, you can include the `graphVariant` (`schemaTag` in `apollo-server` pre-2.13.0) option in your call to the `ApolloServer` constructor, like so:

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  ...
  engine: {
    apiKey: "<APOLLO_KEY>",
    graphVariant: "beta" // highlight-line
  }
});
```

> Make sure you associate Apollo Server's metrics with the correct variant! Otherwise, metrics from your staging and test environments will be included in reports for your production graph.

## Tools that use the schema registry

Keeping your registered schema up to date ensures that you get the best possible experience from Apollo tools that connect to the registry:

- The [Apollo VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo) provides built-in linting on queries by validating against your registered schema. It also annotates fields with their descriptions and with performance indicators collected in Apollo's trace warehouse.
- The [schema validation](/schema-validation/) workflow protects your team from accidentally making breaking schema changes. It creates a diff between your local schema and the last schema pushed to the registry, and validates this diff against live traffic seen on your endpoint to warn you about problematic changes.
- Your schema's full history and current usage can be seen in [Apollo Graph Manager](https://engine.apollographql.com). The History page tracks changes made over time, and the Explorer page shows which clients and which queries are using each field in your schema.
